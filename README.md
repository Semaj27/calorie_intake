<h1>Calorie Intake</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project is a simple command-line program that allows users to track the macronutrient and calorie intake of the foods they eat throughout the day. The program presents a menu with three options: adding a new food, visualizing progress, or quitting the program. 

<h2>Walk Through</h2>
When the user chooses to add a new meal, they are prompted to input the name, calories, protein, fat, and carbohydrates for the food in grams. 
<br />
<br />

<h4>First, a user will select 1 "Add a new meal".</h4>
<br />
<h4>Below shows a user inputing their last 3 meals</h4>
