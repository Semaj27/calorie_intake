<h1>Calorie Intake</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project is a simple command-line program that allows users to track the macronutrient and calorie intake of the foods they eat throughout the day. The program presents a menu with three options: adding a new food, visualizing progress, or quitting the program. This program can help users keep track of their macronutrient and calorie intake throughout the day and visualize their progress towards meeting their daily goals.

<h2>Walk Through</h2>
When the user chooses to add a new meal, they are prompted to input the name, calories, protein, fat, and carbohydrates for the food in grams. 
<br />
<br />

<h4>First, a user will select 1 "Add a new meal".</h4>
<br />
<b>Below shows a user inputing their last 3 meals</b>
